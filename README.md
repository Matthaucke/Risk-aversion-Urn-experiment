# Risk-aversion-Urn-experiment
This is a study that investigates whether the risk aversion effect persists irrespectively of an urn size (size of probability space).

The experiment investigates whether the risk aversion effect (Pulford & Colman, 2008) persists irrespectively of urn size. 
The risk aversion effect describes the phenomena that people do avoid decisions that involve unknown probabilities. 
According to this effect a majority would choose a risky choice when the outcome is 50:50 and not unknown. 
To better understand the relation between effect of urn size and risk aversion, we allocated you to one of the following three conditions:
Presenting an urn containing 100, 10 or 2 marbles. Moreover, we investigated whether the risk aversion persists when people choose a second
time, however this time the other marble is the winning one, while the ratios of marbles in the unknown urn stays the same. If participants
are pure rational decision maker, participants should choose the opposite urn in the second round, since they assumed that there were
either a higher/lower ratio of winning marbles in the unknown urn of the first round.
